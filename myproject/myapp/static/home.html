            Kodaikanal, often called the "Princess of Hill Stations," is a breathtaking hill station nestled amidst the Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu, India.
            Its cool, misty climate, lush green valleys, and cascading waterfalls make it a perfect escape from the scorching plains.
            The star-shaped Kodaikanal Lake, surrounded by rolling hills, offers serene boating experiences.
            Trekkers can explore the misty trails leading to Dolphin's Nose, a unique rock formation offering panoramic views.
            Bryant Park, with its vibrant flowerbeds and diverse flora, is a haven for nature lovers.
            The town's colonial-era architecture, including the historic Bryant's Park and the serene Lutheran Church, adds to its charm.
