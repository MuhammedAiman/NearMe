            Guna Caves, once known as Devil's Kitchen, are a series of deep, narrow crevices shrouded in mystery. 
            Located amidst the lush greenery and towering Pillar Rocks, these caves gained fame after being featured in the iconic Tamil film "Guna." 
            While the caves are not accessible for entry due to safety concerns, visitors can marvel at their imposing structure from a safe distance. 
            The surrounding area, with its dense shola forests and cool mountain breeze, offers a serene and captivating atmosphere.
            Recently the movie "MANJUMMEL BOYS" was filmed there and "Kanmani anbodu kathalan" song was once again famous.
            It then attracted a lot of tourists.
